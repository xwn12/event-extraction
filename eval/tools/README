- release: 13 February, 2011


This package includes the following files:

README		This file.
a2-normalize.pl	A tool for format checking and normalization.
a2-decompose.pl A tool for event decomposition.
a2-evaluate.pl	A tool for evaluation.
a2d-evaluate.pl	A tool for evaluation of decomposed events.

[HISTORY]
22 Feb. 1st Revision
	- A new evaluation mode added.
	  (Approximated Span without Event Trigger Matching)

15 Feb. Initial Release



[INSTALLATION]
Uncompress all the files in a directory and set $PATH to include it.


[USAGE]
Use 'a2-evalute.pl' to get the evaluation results, e.g.

> a2-evaluate.pl -g gold-devel -t1 my_predicted_devel/*.a2
(to evaluate task 1 in the strict evaluation mode)

> a2-evaluate.pl -g gold-devel -t2 -sp my_prediction_eval/*.a2
(to evaluate task 2 in the approximate span and recursive mode)

> a2-decompose.pl gold-devel/*.a2
> a2-decompose.pl my_prediction_eval/*.a2
(to prepare the evaluation of decomposed events) 

> a2-evaluate.pl -g gold-devel -S my_prediction_eval/*.a2d
(to evaluate task 1 with event decomposition in the approximate span mode
without event trigger matching)


[LICENSE]
There is no restriction on the usage of the tools included in this package,
including their modification and re-distribution.
